This does the Eigenvalue decomposition of a given correlation matrix. It writes the product Eigenvector*sqrt(eigenvalue) into a file. 
This file is then to be used by Turnung band to generate the 3D RF.

Call with 3 arguments
Calc_line linelength(int) Filename_out(string) Correlation_length(characteristic correlation length for the corr-function)
