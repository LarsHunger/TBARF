This is just a small tool that reads a sequens of random fields generated by Turning_bands and does some basic sanity checks on them.
It calculates the Expectation and variance for each submitted field, and writes them to stdout.
It also Calculates the Expectation and variance for each coordinate across the sequence of fields submitted (this requires that at least 2 fields are submitted 
but only makes sense starting with around 100 fields) and writes them into a file Expectation_variance_field.dat .
It also calculates the correlation to a reference point at 64,64,64 for each point in the field and writes the results into a file (Correlation.dat)
in the form Corr(point1,reference) distance(point1,reference).

Needs intels Math Kernel Library to be compiled. 
Call with
